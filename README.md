Lamella is a VST3 16 partial additive performance synthesiser plugin focussed on mallet synthesis (bells, membranes, xylophones etc).
Due to its focus on performance and mallets, rather than fine control over each partial, the interface instead presents several parameters and modulations
tuned to give a wide pallet of sounds and dynamics without getting lost in the weeds:

- **Metallic** applies a stretch to the ratio of each partial. Above 0.5 stretches for metallic bell sounds, below 0.5 compresses for membrane / metal sheet sounds.
- **Morph** determines whether the above stretch is linear, or exponential. At 0 there is a linear stretch, above 0.5 the stretch becomes exponential and higher partials are stretched disproportionately more.
- **Refine** allows higher harmonics only to be affected by the above transformations.

- **Blur** applies a noise phase modulation to each partial, blurring the spectrum
-  **Structure** allows mixing between odd and even harmonic makeup (0 is all even, 1 is all odd)
-  **Brightness** applies a tilt to the partial amplitudes, allowing one knob control over treble / fundamental mix
-  **Decays** allows offsetting the decays, making each partial's decay relatively shorter or longer
-  **Organic** introduces random note on variations in harmonic ratio, decay or amplitude for each partial independently

Lamella is unfinished, aiming for a release build in October 2025
